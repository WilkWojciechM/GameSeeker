Hello there!

	Game Seeker is my first project in Hibernate framework.
It's a simple dynamic web application, that allow user to register, edit his account and find his favorite games by tags/hobbies.
Administrator can add games, tags and users into database. It's first (but not final) version of this site.
 
 Thanks !
